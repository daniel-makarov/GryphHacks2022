# GryphHacks2022
🏫 Gateway is a library for developers. It offers over 175 resources regarding learning new technologies, all organized under headings such as Youtube Videos, Documents & Articles, Courses, Funds, and Books. Gateway helps developers find good-quality information for learning new technologies.

## 🔆 Inspiration
As someone who likes to participate and experiment with new technologies, I find it overwhelming to find a starting point. I would constantly hop from docs to a tutorial to docs, losing myself in the chaos of binge-watching tutorials. There was never a site with a clear list of resources I could follow. Whenever I studied new tech, I rarely found good quality resources.

## 👷‍♂️ How we built it
✏️ I first created a sketch of the design and its features. Using this sketch as my draft and guide, I built Gateway using Bootstrap, HTML, and CSS.

## 🤗 Accomplishments
- Building and launching a fully functioning site
- Finding over 175+ resources for developers
- Fixing domain and hosting issues and having the site launch live
- Hackers part of GryphHacks approving, complementing it, and saying that they would use it to find resources when programming.

## 🔮 What's next for Gateway
- We look forward to rewriting the site in React.js to reuse components and have cleaner code.
- Adding thousands of new resources and topics.
- Adding a function where people can upload resources they found useful.
